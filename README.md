# TicTacToe-Learning
This project builds a Markov Chain model that iteratively improves its TicTacToe performance. The file test.py offers functions for building the chain, evaluating its performance, and playing against it. Data for the chain is not included here. In order to build data for the chain, use test.py to execute the 'train' function. Pass the arguments cold=True, name='data.csv', and n=1_000_000. Next execute the 'play' function passing the argument name='data.csv'.
